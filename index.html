                <h2>Wraith</h2>
                <p>
                    Out of all the characters there are to choose from, Wraith is by far my favorite. I find her wide array of abilities the most useful. Her abilities consist of void walking, placing a portal, and voices from the void. Void walking allows you to phase or become invisible for a couple seconds. Placing a portal allows you to place a portal for a set distance, allowing your teammates to also go through it to escape a bad situation. Voices from the void is a passive ability that notifies you when another player is aiming at you.

                <h2>Wattson</h2>
                <p>
                    If Wraith is taken by another player Wattson is my second go to. Shes a little but of a change of pace. While Wraith is an offensive character, Wattson is a defensive character. Her abilities consist of laying fences and the interception pylon. Her fences can create up to 6 electric walls at a time. These walls stun enemies and damage them if crossed. She can also place the interception pylon, which if you're near it charges your shields and blocks incoming bombs. So anything thrown or shot from the sky gets shot down.

                <h2>Octane</h2>
                <p>
                    If it turns out that the other two players I'm playing with both pick one of my first two picks, my next choice would be Octane. Octane is a very fast paced character. His abilities consist of stim, regenerating health, and launchpad. The stim is a syringe of pure adrenaline that causes octane to become much faster, but this comes at a price. Every time you us the stim you lose a little health. This is where the regenerating health comes into play. His health slowly regenerates after using stim or even after being shot. If running isn't enough to get you in or out of a fight, he throws a launchpad thats launches you a pretty far distance in the air.
